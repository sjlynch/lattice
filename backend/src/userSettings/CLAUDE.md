# backend/src/userSettings

Per-project user settings stored at `<project>/.lattice/userSettings.json`.
`../userSettings.ts` is a re-export barrel over this folder, so every consumer
keeps importing from `'../userSettings.js'` and the public surface is unchanged.

## Files

- `types.ts` — the `UserSettings` schema (with all per-field commentary) plus
  the `StartupTerminal` and `TerminalDefaultHarness` types. **No I/O.** Add new
  settings fields here.
- `storage.ts` — the path/storage layer: `settingsFile()`, `getUserSettings()`
  (read-or-`{}`), and `patchUserSettings()` (read-modify-write under the
  per-project `runExclusive('userSettings:<key>')` lock so concurrent disjoint
  patches don't clobber each other — see `serializeWrites.ts` and
  `__tests__/settingsPersistence.test.ts`). All paths are canonicalized via
  `canonicalProjectPath`. Also the **shape boundary** — see the invariant below.
  Writes use atomic temp-to-rename persistence. Display reads may fall back to
  defaults, but a PATCH rejects unreadable/corrupt existing state (incl. valid JSON that is not an object) and preserves
  its bytes; only ENOENT starts from empty settings.
- `features.ts` — feature-specific accessors layered on `getUserSettings`, each
  encoding a field's default semantics: `isClaudeMemoryDisabled`,
  `isPostMergeHookEnabled`, `isCodexYoloEnabled`, `isTaskAgentsLatticeMcpOnly`
  (+ its pure `taskAgentsLatticeMcpOnlyIn(settings)` for callers that already
  hold the settings) (all default ON — an absent field counts as `true`) and `isQaTerminalAutoCloseEnabled` (default
  OFF/stay-open — only explicit `true` opts in), `isKeepWorkflowStepTerminalsEnabled`
  (default OFF — only explicit `true` keeps a finished workflow agent step's
  pty alive; read by the workflow advance to pick `releaseWorkflowStepSession`
  over the kill, see `../workflowRuns/CLAUDE.md`), `isTaskAgentTypecheckEnabled`
  / `taskAgentTypecheckIn` (default OFF — see `../taskVerification.ts`),
  `getTaskWorktreeLfsContent` / `taskWorktreeLfsContentIn` (default
  `'pointers'` — anything but an explicit `'full'`, junk included, is pointer
  mode; see `../worktree/lfsMode.ts`). New "what does setting X mean
  for feature Y" helpers go here.
- `index.ts` — internal barrel re-exporting the public surface.

## Invariants

- **No taskCache import chain.** `storage.ts` imports `PROJECT_DIR_NAME` from
  `../taskCache/paths.js` (the leaf), **not** `../tasks.js` (which re-exports
  the whole task cache). userSettings is read at every Claude spawn by the MCP
  registry and the detached terminal-server, so it must stay free of that heavy
  chain. Keep new imports leaf-scoped.
- **A field the UI trusts field-by-field is coerced in `storage.ts`, on read
  AND on write.** These settings are not written only by the settings dialog:
  agents PATCH `/api/settings` directly, and the route hands the body through as
  `Partial<UserSettings>` — a TypeScript type that describes nothing at
  runtime. `startupTerminals` was stored verbatim as an agent-guessed
  `{name, command}` (no `id`, no `label`), and the dialog's `label.trim()` then
  threw on open, leaving that project's settings un-editable through the only UI
  that could have repaired the row (2026-08-26, interview_eci). So
  `normalizeUserSettings` runs in `getUserSettings` (a corrupt file heals on
  read) and on every incoming patch (a bad write never lands). It is a boundary
  guard, not a schema validator: add a field here only when a malformed value
  would break a consumer, and keep any minted identity **deterministic** — the
  frontend matches a live startup pty to its config by `id`, so an id that
  changed between reads would spawn a duplicate terminal on every reload. Pinned
  by `__tests__/startupTerminalsShape.test.ts`. The same guard covers the
  string-array fields (`deadCodeEntryGlobs`, `metricsIgnoredExts` — non-string /
  blank entries dropped, a non-array becomes absent; a string once made every
  `/api/scan` throw `globs.map is not a function`) and the plain-string fields
  (`postMergeHookPrompt`, `piModel`, `postMergeHookPiModel` — a non-string
  becomes absent). `userSettingsShapeError` lets `PATCH /api/settings` 400 such
  a value instead of silently healing it. Pinned by
  `__tests__/userSettingsFieldShapes.test.ts`.
- **Toggles for removed built-in MCP servers are stripped on read and on
  write** (`mcpOverrides`, `mcpHarnessOverrides.{codex,pi}`; ids in
  `mcp/retiredServers.ts`), so a stale `context7: true` can never switch on a
  custom server that later takes that id.
- **Default semantics live in the accessor, not the type.** A field being
  absent has a specific meaning per feature (memory-off-by-default,
  auto-close-off-by-default); encode that in `features.ts`, mirroring the
  opt-out/opt-in model documented on each field in `types.ts`.
